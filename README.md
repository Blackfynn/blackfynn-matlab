# blackfynn-matlab

This repository contains the source code for the Blackfynn MATLAB client.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Blackfynn/blackfynn-matlab.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Blackfynn/blackfynn-matlab)

## Installation

The Blackfynn MATLAB client can be installed using two methods:

1. Using the MATLAB Toolbox installer (recommended)
2. Directly from the source code (must be able to compile Java files from the command line)

## Installing the Blackfynn Toolbox (recommended)
In order to install the latest release of the MATLAB clientï¼Œfollow the instructions on the Matlab quickstart quide: [MATLAB installation guide](http://help.blackfynn.com/developer-tools/matlab/installing-the-matlab-client). This method automatically handles the Java dependencies and adds the client to the MATLAB path. 

## Installing the client toolbox from source code

1. Download, or checkout the source code from the source code repository [MATLAB client repository](https://github.com/Blackfynn/blackfynn-matlab)
2. (Only for download) Extract contents of the downloaded file into a folder
3. Modify the [MATLAB_LOC] variable in the setup.sh script to point to your local MATLAB executable.
4. Run the setup script:

```shell
>> cd setup
>> ./setup.sh
```

5. Open the resulting toolbox installer to install the local toolbox. 

### Running the local toolbox without installing the toolbox

Instead of installing the toolbox in MATLAB, you can also just point your MATLAB path to the root of the toolbox folder. You will have to run the setup script to make sure that the JAVA files are correctly compiled, but you can skip step 5 and instead:

5. Add the path of the Blackfynn client folder to the MATLAB path. This can be done in MATLAB as follows:

```matlab
>> addpath('/Users/preferred-path/blackfynn-matlab');
```

6. Add the compiled JAVA libraries to your MATLAB dynamic Java classpath:

```matlab
>> javaaddpath('/Users/preferred-path/blackfynn-matlab/java');
```

**NOTE:** These instructions add the Java libraries to MATLAB's dynamic Java path. You will have to add this path every time you start a new MATLAB session or recompile the Java code. You can also add the code to the static path if you do not want to add the Java path for each new MATLAB session. To add the code to the static path, refer to the [MATLAB Documentation](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/javaclasspath.html).
